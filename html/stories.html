				<p>
				It was silent. Pristine, the crystal-blue sky stretched over golden plains, its farmland sighing in reminisce of better times. A single teardrop lay, wilting, on the ground.
				</p>
				<p>
				I am judgement.
				</p>
				<p>
				Not that I wish to be. Their faces haunted me since the moment I stepped from the hull of the <i>Breaking Dusk</i>. It was like duty tore my heart out somewhere along the 170 kilometers of vacant stratosphere as I fell. I've been here before. There's a simple village here, and several more… Farmers, mostly. I remember a small family in the village, an old man and his granddaughter. My mind places their once overjoyed figures before me, the girl smiling from ear to ear. I saved them from the terrible drought that year, I and <i>Fading Dawn</i>, my artifice staff. Bringing water from the heavens. I protected them. They'll remember me as a hero.
				</p>
				<p>
				I stand, attotech metacomposite shoe braced firmly on a rock, and wait for the order.  The horizon is eerily serene. A perfect edge, bringing the sky and earth together as one. My heartbeat quickens with each passing second, as if I expect a legion of veristeel knives to burst open the fragile seam of sunset, and tear the earth asunder. The wheat fields tremble in anticipation. <i>Fading Dawn</i> stands with me now, arcane signets twirling gently around her core. It's time.
				</p>
				<p>
				A voice materializes beside my ear: "Command hailing Bladekeeper Eyv Sanne. Italkdri forces have established ground contact. Commence regional firebombing."
				</p>
				<p>
				I hesitate. Is it worth the sacrifice?
				</p>
				<p>
				I hope so.
				</p>
				<p>
				"Acknowledged, command. Commencing firebombing," my voice responds.
				</p>
				<p>
				I call upon the power of the <i>Fading Dawn</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<blockquote>
					Of breaking dawn,<br>
					Of fading dusk,<br>
					Bring forth the acolytes of fire.<br>
					With vengeful soul,<br>
					This wretched land,<br>
					Lay on, with brimstone dire.
					</blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
				… I watch, heartbroken, as the vast orbital arrays of the starborne Breaking Dusk collapse the sky with trembling laserfire. The battlements of the heavens lay siege to the brittle crust before me, columns of thunderous light splitting the atmosphere from base to vault to form a new, radiant horizon, crosswise to its predecessor.
				</p>
				<p>
				The brilliance fades, leaving a scarred, broken terrain.
				</p>
				<p>
					<blockquote>
					… And may the innocent whose lives we claim,<br>
					These souls the halls of time can't name,<br>
					Give heart to warriors of every shore,<br>
					That strength may end this hellish war.
					</blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
				I step back. I've fulfilled my duty today. I wish I could have fulfilled theirs too.<br>
				I step into the sky, and my wake follows me. A hundred kilometers in the drop of a tear.
