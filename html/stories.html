					<p>
					It was calm. Pristine, the crystal-blue sky stretched over golden plains, its farmland sighing in reminisce of better times. On the ground, a single teardrop lay, still warm from the touch of my cheek.
					</p>
					<p>
					I am judgement.
					</p>
					<p>
					Not that I wish to be. Their faces haunted me since the moment I stepped from the hull of the <i>Breaking Dusk</i>. It was like duty tore my heart out somewhere along the 170 kilometers of vacant stratosphere as I fell. I've been here before. There's a simple village here, and several more… Farmers, mostly. I remember a small family in the village, an old man and his granddaughter. My mind places their once overjoyed figures before me, the girl smiling from ear to ear. I saved them from the terrible drought that year, I and <i>Fading Dawn</i>, my artifice staff. Bringing water from the heavens. I protected them. They'll remember me as a hero.
					</p>
					<p>
					I stand, attotech metacomposite shoe braced firmly on a rock, and wait for the order.  The horizon is eerily serene. A perfect edge, bringing the sky and earth together as one. My heartbeat quickens with each passing second, as if I expect a legion of veristeel knives to burst open the fragile seam of sunset, and tear the earth asunder. The wheat fields tremble in anticipation. <i>Fading Dawn</i> stands with me now, arcane signets twirling gently around her core. It's time.
					</p>
					<p>
					A voice materializes beside my ear: "Command hailing Bladekeeper Eyv Sanne. Italkdri forces have established ground contact. Commence regional firebombing."
					</p>
					<p>
					I hesitate. Is it worth the sacrifice?
					</p>
					<p>
					I hope so.
					</p>
					<p>
					"Acknowledged, command. Commencing firebombing," my voice responds.
					</p>
					<p>
					I call upon the power of the <i>Fading Dawn</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
						Of breaking dawn,<br>
						Of fading dusk,<br>
						Bring forth the acolytes of fire.<br>
						With vengeful soul,<br>
						This wretched land,<br>
						Lay on, with brimstone dire.
						</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>
					… I watch, heartbroken, as the vast orbital arrays of the starborne Breaking Dusk collapse the sky with trembling laserfire. The battlements of the heavens lay siege to the brittle crust before me, columns of thunderous light splitting the atmosphere from base to vault to form a new, radiant horizon, crosswise to its predecessor.
					</p>
					<p>
					The brilliance fades, leaving a scarred, broken terrain.
					</p>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
						… And may the innocent whose lives we claim,<br>
						These souls the halls of time can't name,<br>
						Give heart to warriors of every shore,<br>
						That strength may end this hellish war.
						</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>
					I step back. I've fulfilled my duty today. I wish I could have fulfilled theirs too.<br>
					I step into the sky, and my wake follows me. A hundred kilometers in the drop of a tear.

					<p id="fe8e2ce0-50de-4c38-a647-b3fff64a9eda" class="">The cool evening breeze was restful. Maybe too restful for an evening out with a firing squad in an abandoned industrial slum. Althea leaned against a rusty steel column, eyelids over dull mauve iris beginning to droop from boredom. &#x27;<em>The target will show up&#x27;</em>, they said, &#x27;<em>she&#x27;s running out of time&#x27;</em>, they said. And for this, Althea Stratos is standing around a metal graveyard at 0300 hours with a merry band of thugs with rifles, collecting condensation. <em>Ugh. I hate my life.</em>
					</p>
					<p id="d08deb74-485d-45f5-91a4-f470c3a22b4d" class=""><em>Tap</em>. (<em>Tap. tap.</em>)<br>
					A sound echoed through the silent alley.
					</p>
					<p id="d6aa1348-5347-4c89-8b0e-f6207acdeac2" class="">Althea pushed herself off the beam, stretched, and yawned. &quot;You sure took your time.&quot; Althea glanced over the shadowy figure outlined in reflected moonlight, apparently only marginally less bored than before. &quot;The &#x27;Volcanic Queen&#x27;, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
					<p id="c227ae4b-339d-4ad4-a6f5-53d04a00dc31" class="">The silence yielded to the quieted shuffling of gunmen readying their weapons with unmistakable metallic clicks.</p>
					<p id="b3fcc03c-2a05-444b-b103-42c1352e1877" class="">&quot;You are facing an opponent beyond your class.&quot; A strong, clear voice warned at a volume slightly louder than comfortable. &quot;Any attacks will be answered with a similar response. That is, if you attempt lethal force, you will die. Understood?&quot;</p>
					<p id="3b7c3778-ffda-45e8-a380-8b5cdacaa90f" class="">&quot;Heh,&quot; Althea sneered. &quot;Sure.&quot;<br>
					&quot;<em>Fire.</em>&quot;
					</p>
					<p id="ad61b043-6546-471d-af3e-76cf04c7200b" class="">One-hundred and forty decibels of automatic weapons-fire crashed across the concrete.</p>

					<p id="d323a59f-d955-45ea-8150-4367c7fd5767" class="">The sound of beeping monitors, and my breathing. Darkness. This isn&#x27;t right.<br>
					I opened my eyes. They responded slower than I would&#x27;ve liked. </p>
					<p id="84564c93-9143-4153-ae6d-913640469083" class=""><em>Ugh, light. Regret. </em>I winced.
					</p>
					<p id="f001063a-9390-46c0-b40f-30c80e902e3c" class="">The blinding light subsided a bit, allowing my eyes to focus on a girl&#x27;s face hovering above my own, light-hazel eyes looking at mine, her dark amber hair falling aside me. I don&#x27;t know her. <em>Do I have amnesia? No, that&#x27;d be dumb, and I still remember fighting...</em> This is bad.
					</p>
					<p id="3acb62a5-34a2-4b86-ac0e-597d20caff00" class="">I tried to speak. &quot;Wh- Where am I? Who a-&quot;</p>
					<p id="5ccb7303-9657-49aa-bb21-8caa34f90ebf" class=""><strong>&quot;Dead.&quot;</strong> A stern reply came from the end of the room. Wiggling my fingers and toes to check if they could move, I looked down towards the speaker. A figure in a slim, dark robe adorned with a fiery marigold half-cape to match her blonde hair posed with a wineglass in front of a black, floor-to-ceiling display filled with medical information.
					</p>
					<p id="4f89ae16-7f39-4551-9e5b-037cab4a547d" class="">There are a lot of first thoughts you could have when realizing you are under the power of someone who had recently become your mortal enemy in a duel to the death, promising to kill you. You could think &quot;Help, I&#x27;m going to die&quot;, or &quot;I need to run for my life&quot;, or &quot;Please don&#x27;t kill me I have a family&quot; (even if you don&#x27;t have any living relatives), or of any number of ways to attempt to extricate yourself from this life-threatening circumstance.</p>
					<p id="b2b89aec-940e-471c-a116-f6fce1091405" class="">My first thoughts? <em>&#x27;Hey, that&#x27;s my target!!&#x27;</em><br>I jolted up from the bed and immediately screamed as a wall of pain slammed through my left side for the approximately 4 centimetres I had violently moved. As soon as I could blink the tears out of my eyes, and my vision focused again, I glanced to my left. My arm was in a cast, strapped to the bunk. So was my leg.
					</p>
					<p id="7fdc2a4a-3bec-41e0-8176-e75fc35890f5" class=""><em>Damn.</em><br>
					...<br>
					<em>Dammit. This is </em><em><strong>really</strong></em><em> bad. Am I... going to...</em>
					</p>
					<p id="2820e3bf-76f7-4ac6-aefb-17af4ca12b0d" class="">&quot;Hmmh,&quot; the as-written-in-briefing &#x27;Volcanic Queen&#x27; amusedly exhaled. I could tell she was smirking, even facing away from me. The little- </p>
					<p id="f3b26bd3-fca6-4516-929e-f2c9954c71ef" class="">&quot;Or... I suppose you could call it, <em>the Afterlife</em>&quot;, she continued, stressing &#x27;Afterlife&#x27; a bit too much, as if I was supposed to <em>get it</em>. <em>Afterlife,</em> I recalled, something in there about an underground organization. <em>Probably who she works for.</em>
					</p>
					<p id="b2167fc8-c877-40db-a164-1b77d8b02a3d" class="">I gritted my teeth. &quot;What - do you want - from me?&quot;</p>
					<p id="58e34594-2984-4abd-af23-a3d0327f3c9b" class="">She turned to face me. &quot;Ah, straight to business, I see.&quot; I could sense her smugness through my exaggeratedly long blink, inhaling to recentre myself.</p>
					<p id="71ff5f0d-7ad0-4a7e-b81f-762cef9c91f3" class="">&quot;If you think you can get me to talk, you can go to-&quot;</p>
					<p id="53ea6f52-efdc-4489-8a46-1adc253e7c46" class="">&quot;And what, exactly, would I want to know from a third-rate pawn posted on guard duty?&quot; she asked, cutting me off.</p>
					<p id="c59d6f18-90b8-44b6-ac99-974f9188661c" class="">&quot;Well, I honestly didn&#x27;t think that far, but you&#x27;re not getting it.&quot; It was true, I was honestly lost as to what reason this <em>Afterlife</em> would want me alive and healthy other than to torture me back to death. Even though I would probably crack after about five seconds of any actual effective method. I&#x27;m not particularly loyal, I just have my pride to maintain.
					</p>
					<p id="4ef77fed-49cc-4bc4-bc89-e80efa7bda1a" class="">The blonde sighed, slowly losing her smirk to a more grave expression. &quot;This is about <em>your future.</em>&quot;
					</p>
					<p id="75f55db3-2478-4b1b-b61c-ccc6894b6c75" class="">I had nothing but a blank stare to give for that. <em>Um, I left academics to be a professional criminal like two years ago, lady. What is this, social rehab? Somehow that sounds worse than being tortured to death. Kill me now.</em>
					</p>
					<p id="233b4ed3-2c66-47ee-b851-93796ac6bb21" class="">&quot;I promise every opponent that if they try to kill me, they will die. You are no exception.&quot; She made a gesture with her hand, and the dark wall at the end of the room switched from monitor graphs to a live news feed, showing satellite footage from the latest organized crime detail in the derelict industrial district. <em>Seventeen confirmed casualties. Among them, young criminal operator Althea Stratos. I see. So I <strong>am</strong> dead.</em>
					</p>
					<p id="774a7095-f6ec-4570-9057-ee7ff65c3ae0" class="">&quot;To this end, I offer a choice.&quot; The blonde lady walked up to my bed/prison and swung a virtual tray with two document binders on it in front of me, one black, and one considerably thicker red folder. She explained: &quot;The black folder contains the paperwork we would file if you choose to leave. The death report was premature; you were miraculously saved by the venerable efforts of a talented doctor. You could go back to...&quot; she waved her hand in a leisurely, expansive gesture. &quot;Whoever it is you trust, to be dealt with in the way that they deal with their own.&quot;</p>
					<p id="e8a23ba1-928c-45a1-bd3a-a08bb2c5ded6" class="">I eyed her warily. &quot;And... you... want me to spy on them?&quot; I guessed.</p>
					<p id="dfc6accf-ec81-4ec7-9bf0-91337ce0a5dc" class="">&quot;Nothing of the sort&quot;, she responded, looking almost mildly offended at the notion. &quot;The red folder contains a new identity. Althea Stratos, the professional combat specialist, died. To no one outside Afterlife, you lived.&quot;</p>
					<p id="faaff780-779d-4af2-916e-bd575e0dbe1b" class="">&quot;What do you get out of this? Another attotech-happy lackey?&quot; <em>Out of one underworld organization, into the next. Pfft, what a recruiting process though. I&#x27;m <strong>captivated</strong>. Aha.</em>
					</p>
					<p id="eb919453-653d-4105-94ff-e1d4993a97c5" class="">&quot;That is certainly a crude way of putting it, but yes. I came to quite an appreciation of your skill last night.&quot; She turned and walked toward the exit. &quot;You can call me Kira. Take your time.&quot; The side girl with the hazel eyes, who I had forgotten was even there, broke a slight smile and glanced at the red document as Kira spoke as if expecting her to say a line she had heard a thousand times: &quot;Stay a while, and maybe you&#x27;ll see why <em>all</em> of my opponents - <em>have died</em>.&quot;
					</p>
