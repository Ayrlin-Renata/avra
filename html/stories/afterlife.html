        <p id="fe8e2ce0-50de-4c38-a647-b3fff64a9eda" class="">The cool evening breeze was restful. Maybe
            <em>too</em> restful for an evening out with a firing squad in an abandoned industrial slum. Althea
            leaned against a rusty steel column, eyelids over dull mauve iris beginning to droop from boredom.
            <em><mark class="highlight-gray">&#x27;The target will show up&#x27;, they said, &#x27;she&#x27;s
                    running out of time&#x27;, they said. And for this, Althea Stratos is standing around a
                    metal graveyard at 0300 hours with a merry band of thugs with rifles, collecting
                    condensation. Ugh. I hate my life.</mark></em></p>
        <p id="d08deb74-485d-45f5-91a4-f470c3a22b4d" class=""><em>Tap</em>. (<em>Tap. tap.</em>) A sound echoed
            through the silent alley.</p>
        <p id="d6aa1348-5347-4c89-8b0e-f6207acdeac2" class="">Althea pushed herself off the beam, stretched, and
            yawned. <mark class="highlight-purple">&quot;You sure took your time.&quot;</mark> Althea glanced
            over the shadowy figure outlined in reflected moonlight, apparently only marginally less bored than
            before. <mark class="highlight-purple">&quot;The &#x27;Volcanic Queen&#x27;, isn&#x27;t

        <p id="c227ae4b-339d-4ad4-a6f5-53d04a00dc31" class="">The silence yielded to the quieted shuffling of

            slightly louder than comfortable. <mark class="highlight-yellow">&quot;Any attacks will be answered
                with a similar response. That is, if you attempt lethal force, you will die.

            eyes to focus on a girl&#x27;s face hovering above my own. Her light-hazel eyes were gazing
            curiously into mine, dark amber hair falling aside me. I didn&#x27;t recognize her. <mark
                class="highlight-gray"><em>Do I have amnesia? No, that&#x27;d be dumb, and I still remember

                class="highlight-yellow">&quot;Dead.&quot;</mark> A stern reply came from the end of the room.
            Wiggling my fingers and toes to check if they could move, I strenuously lifted my head to look down
            towards the speaker. A blonde figure in a slim, dark robe adorned with a fiery marigold half-cape,
            wineglass in hand, stood imposingly in front of a black floor-to-ceiling display filled with medical
            information.</p>
        <p id="4f89ae16-7f39-4551-9e5b-037cab4a547d" class="">There are a lot of first thoughts you could have
            when realizing you are under the power of someone who had recently become your mortal enemy in a
            duel to the death. You could think &quot;Help, I&#x27;m gonna die!&quot;, or &quot;Running for my
            life, is a great idea!&quot;, or &quot;Please don&#x27;t kill me, I have a family, I swear!&quot;,
            or of any number of other ways to try to extricate yourself from this life-threatening ordeal.</p>

            and immediately screamed as a wall of pain slammed through my left side, punishment for the
            approximately 4 centimetres I had moved. I tried to blink the tears out of my eyes, waiting for my
            vision to focus again. I glanced to my left. My arm was in a cast, strapped to the bunk. So was my
            leg.</p>

            &#x27;Afterlife&#x27; a bit too much, as if I was supposed to <em>get it</em>. <mark
                class="highlight-gray"><em>Afterlife,</em></mark> I recalled, <mark

                class="highlight-yellow">&quot;Ah, straight to business, I see.&quot;</mark> I could sense her
            smugness. I closed my eyes, inhaling to recentre myself.</p>

                exactly, would I want to know from a third-rate pawn posted on guard duty?&quot;</mark> she
            asked, cutting me off.</p>
        <p id="c59d6f18-90b8-44b6-ac99-974f9188661c" class=""><mark class="highlight-purple">&quot;Well, I

            was honestly lost as to what reason this <em>Afterlife</em> would want me alive and healthy other
            than to torture me back to death. Even though I would probably crack after about five seconds of any
            actual torture method. I&#x27;m not particularly loyal, I just have my pride to maintain.</p>
        <p id="4ef77fed-49cc-4bc4-bc89-e80efa7bda1a" class="">The blonde sighed, her smirk slowly fading into a
            more grave expression. <mark class="highlight-yellow">&quot;This is about </mark><mark

        <p id="75f55db3-2478-4b1b-b61c-ccc6894b6c75" class="">I had nothing but a blank stare to give for that.
            <mark class="highlight-gray"><em>Um, I left academics to be a professional criminal like two years
                    ago, lady. What is this, social rehab? Somehow that sounds worse than being tortured to

            She made a gesture with her hand, and the dark monitoring graphs at the end of the room yielded
            priority to a live news feed. Satellite footage from the latest organized crime detail in the
            derelict industrial district.

                I offer a choice.&quot;</mark> The blonde lady walked up to my bed/prison and swiped a virtual
            tray at me. Two covered documents fluttered to life in front of me: one black, and one red, although
            this one was considerably thicker. <mark class="highlight-yellow">&quot;The black folder contains
                the paperwork we would file if you choose to leave. The death report was premature; you were
                miraculously saved by the venerable efforts of a talented doctor. You could go back

                class="highlight-yellow">&quot;Whoever it is you trust, to be dealt with in the way that they

        <p id="e8a23ba1-928c-45a1-bd3a-a08bb2c5ded6" class="">I eyed her warily. <mark

                class="highlight-yellow">&quot;The red folder contains a new identity. Althea Stratos, the
                professional combat specialist, died. To no one outside Afterlife, you lived.&quot;</mark></p>

                class="highlight-yellow">&quot;You can call me Kira. Take your time.&quot;</mark> The side girl
            with the hazel eyes, who I had forgotten was even there, glanced at the red document in a kindly,
            sympathetic manner as Kira spoke, a slight smile tugging at her lips. She almost seemed to already
            remember Kira&#x27;s next words to me: <mark class="highlight-yellow">&quot;Stay a while, and maybe

        <p id="f32e01a0-f87d-4715-8557-9b3f084e2e5c" class="">The door slid open. And closed, just as quickly.
