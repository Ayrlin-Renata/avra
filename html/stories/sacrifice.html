        <p> It was calm. Pristine, the crystal-blue sky stretched over golden plains, its farmland sighing in
            reminisce of better times. On the ground, a single teardrop lay, still warm from the touch of my
            cheek. </p>
        <p> I am judgement. </p>
        <p> Not that I wish to be. Their faces haunted me since the moment I stepped from the hull of the
            <i>Breaking Dusk</i>. It was like duty tore my heart out somewhere along the 170 kilometers of
            vacant stratosphere as I fell. I've been here before. There's a simple village here, and several
            more… Farmers, mostly. I remember a small family in the village, an old man and his granddaughter.
            My mind places their once overjoyed figures before me, the girl smiling from ear to ear. I saved
            them from the terrible drought that year, I and <i>Fading Dawn</i>, my artifice staff. Bringing
            water from the heavens. I protected them. They'll remember me as a hero. </p>
        <p> I stand, attotech metacomposite shoe braced firmly on a rock, and wait for the order. The horizon is
            eerily serene. A perfect edge, bringing the sky and earth together as one. My heartbeat quickens
            with each passing second, as if I expect a legion of veristeel knives to burst open the fragile seam
            of sunset, and tear the earth asunder. The wheat fields tremble in anticipation. <i>Fading Dawn</i>
            stands with me now, arcane signets twirling gently around her core. It's time. </p>
        <p> A voice materializes beside my ear: "Command hailing Bladekeeper Eyv Sanne. Italkdri forces have
            established ground contact. Commence regional firebombing." </p>
        <p> I hesitate. Is it worth the sacrifice? </p>
        <p> I hope so. </p>
        <p> "Acknowledged, command. Commencing firebombing," my voice responds. </p>
        <p> I call upon the power of the <i>Fading Dawn</i>. </p>
        <p>
        <blockquote> Of breaking dawn,<br> Of fading dusk,<br> Bring forth the acolytes of fire.<br> With
            vengeful soul,<br> This wretched land,<br> Lay on, with brimstone dire. </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p> … I watch, heartbroken, as the vast orbital arrays of the starborne Breaking Dusk collapse the sky
            with trembling laserfire. The battlements of the heavens lay siege to the brittle crust before me,
            columns of thunderous light splitting the atmosphere from base to vault to form a new, radiant
            horizon, crosswise to its predecessor. </p>
        <p> The brilliance fades, leaving a scarred, broken terrain. </p>
        <p>
        <blockquote> … And may the innocent whose lives we claim,<br> These souls the halls of time can't
            name,<br> Give heart to warriors of every shore,<br> That strength may end this hellish war.
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p> I step back. I've fulfilled my duty today. I wish I could have fulfilled theirs too.<br> I step into
            the sky, and my wake follows me. A hundred kilometers in the drop of a tear. </p>
